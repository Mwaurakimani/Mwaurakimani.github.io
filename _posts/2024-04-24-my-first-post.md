## What is it Used for?
Welcome to the Swiss Army knife of the digital world! A website is your Swiss Army knife – versatile, indispensable, and ready for any task. Need to showcase your business? Sell your handmade crafts? Share your passion for underwater basket weaving? A website can do it all and more.

## Should I Get a Website?
In a word: absolutely! Think of a website as your digital calling card, your neon sign in the digital sky, your secret weapon in the battle for attention.
